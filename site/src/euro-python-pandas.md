# Pandas and Python #

- Pandas for big data analysis
- extract knowledge from existing dataset and transform into human readable format
- Data management is a huge industry 100 BLN on just data center infrastructure and 24 BLN on database tech
- biggest problem is actually not the infrastructure but the physical space for the server racks
- thus fast data mining is 100% important
- fast data mining = rapid development + quick execution

### Tools ###

- pandas.Series class, is obviously used often - Series([1,2,3,4,5], index=['a','b','c','d'','e']) many many methods available
- pytables FTW, not a db replacement but excellent for tmp computations for speed!
- 

### Useful ###
- <http://www.visixion.com/?attachment_id=714> the presentation
- derivatives and analytics with python (not really python lots of theory but interesting none-the-less) includes all code and everything!
