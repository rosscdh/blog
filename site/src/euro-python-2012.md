# Europython 2012.. #

I am seriously looking forward to [EuroPython2012](https://ep2012.europython.eu/p3/ep2012/whos-coming). 

The conference takes place in Florence, Italy. A city that has been on my visit-list for a very long time.

My collegue "**MartinO**" and I, depart Dusseldorf on Sunday 1.7.2012 and will be attending for the entire week.

This blog is where, I will try to give a running list of the information that is absorbed! Both for my collegues at [Adcloud](http://adcloud.com) and for whoever stumbles across it in the future.

Ill try to execute the coverage in the same manner that **Reinout van Rees** has done previously for [djangocon](http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2012/06/index.html).. which I have found to be incredibly informative.

The conference is unfortunately not single-track and Martin and I will try to attend teh most interesting/useful talks of the day. Failing that, then will be outside in the sun eating gelato!
