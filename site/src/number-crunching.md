### "The Boring Stuff" ###

- fp numbers
- brute force vs clever
- but brute force is not necessarily mindless
- we are not evil but rather chaotic evil
- Alternatives: Matlab, Octave (clone of matlab), R (stats oriented. poor general purpose programming support)
- Fortran/C++ ver low level but complex
- these are all too low level GP or high level DSL
- Python: numpy. scipy excellent numerical comps and lots of packages.. ipython cli
- HDF5 (pytables) difficult to integrate with
- Specific libs for machine learning
- GPOOP

#### Why is numpy good? ####

- highly optimized code, complex computation and handles its own resolution and is very fast
- numpy is always a trade off between space (memory) and time contig ndarrays
- create matrix from ndarray.. 2 matrices M * M will produce a new array
- standard python slicing can be applied and uses the original memory and not new mem
