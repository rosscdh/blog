# Arduino & Python #

- Arduino is named after an italian king
- Intro to arduino and its capabilities
- is a basic system with 2k RAM not enough for an os, so dont go overboard
- very extensible with a number of addons "shields" that can do everythign form GSM to bluetooth

### Python and Arduino ###

- pyfirmata
- allows you to code in python and connect to the board directly from the pc
- ?is there a module to convert the python into a scheme (arduino lang)
- the scheme lang is "slow" but how slow is slow to a microcontroller guy? probably within acceptable limits
- remember arduino is a prototyping device and not really for production usage
