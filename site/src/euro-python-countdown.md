# Countdown to Europython 2012.. #

Only a few more days; I'm placing the final email from the organization here for my own reference.


Hello Ross Crawford-d&#39;Heureuse,

this is our last communication before EuroPython. To make sure you get the best out of your ticket, this is a checklist of things you should know about the conference:

* We have an interactive schedule where you can browse, search, favorite talks, create a personalized schedule and so on (make sure to login):
https://ep2012.europython.eu/p3/schedule/ep2012/

* We also have a (offline) mobile guide through the Guidebook app:
https://ep2012.europython.eu/mobile#guide

* 4-hours trainings have a booking system in place, through the schedule; booking a seat is optional, but gives precedence in case the room gets full. Login and book your training:
https://ep2012.europython.eu/p3/schedule/ep2012/

* We are launching a new helpdesk service at EuroPython: you can book a 30-min slot and get free help from an experienced programmer on a specific Python-related technology or framework. Helpdesk booking is available through the schedule:

* Going to join the sprints? Have a look at the sprint list, submit your sprint, or join an existing one:

* Not only talks: browse our participant list by tag, interest, country, and make your personal profile public; get in touch with people you want to meet at the conference before getting there:

* There are still tickets available for Partner Program Tours on Saturday 30th and Sunday 1st (plus others). Take a break from the conference and enjoy Florence, Tuscany, food, wine and museums:
